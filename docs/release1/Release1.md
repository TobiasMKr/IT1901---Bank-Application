# Documentation for release 1

In release 1, our primary focus was creating the initial user interface, and creating the logic to save the balance to file. In release 1, the only functionality is showing the balance, deposit and withdraw. The balance is stored in a json-file, providing insurance that the data will not be lost if the application is closed.
