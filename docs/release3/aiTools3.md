  ### AI Tools Utilized
 
  In this project, we have leveraged some AI tools to enhance our development process. Specifically, we have used ChatGPT for the following purpose:
 
  - **Solving errors**: ChatGPT has been employed to help identify our problemce and reduce debugging time. We have mostly used it to help us implement different dependencies. We often struggle to implement new dependencies that we haven't worked with earlier, often due to tiny errors. ChatGPT helped us recognize these errors and solve them, while also learning from our mistakes.
 
  By integrating ChatGPT into our workflow, we have been able to streamline our development process and ensure a higher standard of code reliability.
