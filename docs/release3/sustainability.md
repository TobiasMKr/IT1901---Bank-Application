# Sustainability Aspects in Our Project

In our project, we have emphasized demonstrating sustainability through the following points: individual, social, economic, and environmental sustainability.

## Individual Sustainability

Immediately, a digital bank can help make banking services more accessible to customers daily. Customers will no longer have to visit a physical bank to make deposits, withdrawals, or check their balance, as these services will be available on their own mobile devices. This may help enhancing the persons mental health, because this may help reduce a persons stress-levels because they can now stop going around and wondering if they have enough money to afford different items. The digital bank will also enhance the security of personal finances, as individuals can check their balance more frequently to stay alert to any fraudulent activities. In a systemic way, easier access for useres to their accounts allows users to build competence over time in understanding how their personal finances work, and they gain insight into how a bank operates.

## Social Sustainability

Immediately this will make banking services much more accessible to people who live far away, allowing them to devote more of their free time to activities they prefer rather than spending time traveling to and from the bank. This increased accessibility also enhances users' daily awareness of their own finances, as they can continuously monitor their balance from their mobile devices. The digital bank will make it easier for groups who are planning on doing activities that cost money, because everyone has access to their economic state at any given time.

## Economic Sustainability

In short term a digital bank will reduce the bank's operating costs by cutting expenses related to renting premises, electricity, storage and transportation of physical money, and the number of employees. The 24/7 availability of the bank will lead to increased use of banking services and thereby higher revenues. In a systemic way, digital bank will not have geographical limitations regarding its customer base, which will improve the bank's financial standing and, in turn, offer customers better terms. Both customers and employees will save money on transportation costs to and from the bank, which will improve their personal finances.

## Environmental Sustainability

A digital bank will significantly reduce both the bank's and the customer's need for physical bills and coins, resulting in decreased production and a reduced need for paper. It will also lessen the need for physical bank buildings, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions from these structures. Both employees and customers will avoid commuting to and from work, reducing the need for transportation methods and consequently resulting in lower greenhouse gas emissions from these vehicles.

## Technical Sustainability

Our application is easy to maintain, as we are using Spotbugs to spot bugs in the code early on. A bug might bring fatal consenquenses for our application, as it is relying on few, but very important functionalities. Therefore it is important that we can spot bugs early. Our system is very easy to use productively, as it consist of easy-to-use elements and it is simple in it's design. You dont need any specific knowledge or physical properties. 
With the use of React for our frontend, we bring certain advantages in flexibility and scalability. React's components-based architecture makes it easy to introduce new elements abnd features by creating reusable components. This modularity allows us to add new features without extensive rework of the existing codebase, making updates and changes more manageable. If our application were to be used by larger amounts of people, our system would likely suffer performance degradation including slower response times and increased error-rates.
